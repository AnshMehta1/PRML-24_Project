# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Project Readme

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, specifically using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for processing structured grid-like data, such as images.

## About CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset are:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are well-suited for tasks involving image recognition and classification. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Key Components of CNNs:
- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolutional filters to input images, extracting features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, reducing computational complexity and enhancing translation invariance.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Fully connected layers process the high-level features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers, mapping them to class labels.

## About This Project
This project implements a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.
